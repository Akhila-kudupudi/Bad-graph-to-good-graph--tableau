## 📄 Abstract

This project explores the transformation of a data visualization focused on the **gender pay gap across U.S. industries**. The original graph lacked clarity and accessibility. Through the use of **Tableau**, the visualization was redesigned to improve interpretability, introducing:

- ✅ Horizontal bar charts
- ✅ Aligned baselines
- ✅ High color contrast
- ✅ Interactive tooltips

These enhancements allow for more intuitive understanding and better communication of insights.
