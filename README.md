## Abstract
This project explores the transformation of a data visualization focusing on the gender pay gap across U.S. industries. The original graph, characterized by its complexity and lack of clarity, undergoes a redesign in Tableau to enhance interpretability and accessibility. Key improvements include the introduction of horizontal bar charts, aligned baselines, enhanced color contrast, and interactive tooltips—achieving greater clarity and a more intuitive understanding of the data.

## 1. Introduction
The gender pay gap persists across all sectors of the U.S. economy, with disparities varying by industry. This project highlights median earnings in 2019 using data from the US Census Bureau. For instance, finance and insurance show the largest gap, where men earn significantly more than women. The project aims to provide a detailed analysis of gender income inequality and explore effective design principles to communicate this complex data more clearly.

## 2. Problem Statement
The problem tackled is the ineffective communication of data due to poorly designed visualizations—specifically a graph that depicts the gender pay gap across industries. The project goal is to refine this visualization for improved clarity, accessibility, and engagement. This transformation emphasizes the importance of strong data visualization practices in effectively conveying key societal issues.

## 3. Purpose
This project demonstrates how a poorly constructed graph can be transformed into a more effective and insightful visualization using best practices. The goal is to enhance understanding of wage disparities across industries and stress the importance of visual clarity in communicating data for public awareness and policy decisions.
